# CSS Diner

### In this project, I created a trainer to learn css selectors. The simulator consists of several game levels. Each level includes an example layout and html code that corresponds to the current level.

### The user's task is to write a css selector that matches all selected layout elements.

### The simulator prototype is the [CSS Diner app](https://flukeout.github.io/).

### Deploy : [App](https://my-css-diner.netlify.app/)
